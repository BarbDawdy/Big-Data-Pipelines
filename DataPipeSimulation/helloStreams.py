#  program - helloStreams.py
#  usage - dependent on afileSimulator jar file -n was set to 200
#          helloStreams.py is run directly in pycharm or by using python.ext and full path to the helloStreams.py program
#  note -  expected to be run in python version 3.x or greater
#
#  description - see https://gitlab2.bigdata220uw.mooo.com/jhenri/uwbd-instructions/blob/master/Assignment%202:%20Hello%20Stream.md
#  assumptions -
#                o	All storage internal in program was based on store and product (only 1) was not considered at this time.
#                o	It was assumed that a â€“n (number) of 200 generated records to the jar file was sufficient for the output needed by the teacher.
#                o	Since only one product I used a simple dictionary structure which allowed for simple storage of the inventory changes and alerts due to
#                   only one product.  With more than one product I would need to be more complex data structure which would include storage of the store and product.
#                o	Frequency was determined by quantity change divided time since last purchase or event.  Previous time was stored in a dictionary by store and used with the current event time for that store to get a delta time.
#                o	Per the class office hrs I assumed it was acceptable to display all information in Q2 from the assignment in the json output event line and also to display the alert message when it occurred.
#                o	3 different alert messages were provided: one when inventory =<5 but inventory >0, when inventory = 0, and when inventory goes negative.  This could be used for escalation notification
#                   in future for that stores management or inventory dept. in real world.
